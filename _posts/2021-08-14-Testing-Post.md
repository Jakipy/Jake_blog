This is Jake's github blog pages

Several times a week, I am going to post in my blog anything realted to computer and programming. If I get hectic with my school or whatever, I might not post for a few weeks. Purpose of this blog is to keep track of things that I study while doing self-coding projects and share them with people on internet. 

You are always welcomed to copy and paste any type of code in my blog because there is a high chance that I might have also copied some codes from stackoverflow or github where you contirubyuted. Thanks for you visit!
