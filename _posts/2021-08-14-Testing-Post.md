This is a Jake's github blog pages

Few times a week I am going to post in my blog anything about computer and programming related. If I get hectic with my school or whatever, I might not post for few weeks.
Purpose of this blog is to keep track of things that I study while doing self projects. Contents of post might change frequently. I might post about sorting alogrithms and big O notation and the other day I will post about Basic Commands. Your welcome to copy and paste any type of code in my blog because there is high chance that I might have also copied from stackoverflow or github. Thanks!
