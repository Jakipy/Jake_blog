This is Jake's github blog pages

Few times a week, I am going to post in my blog anything about computer and programming related. If I get hectic with my school or whatever, I might not post for few weeks.
Purpose of this blog is to keep track of things that I study while doing self coding projects. Contents of posts might change frequently. I might post about sorting alogrithms and big O notation and the other day I will post about Linux Basic Commands. Your welcome to copy and paste any type of code in my blog because there is high chance that I might have also copied from stackoverflow or github. Thanks!
